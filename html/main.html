    <p id="about">Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far 
        that’s <br>  inhabited by living things. 
        While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is <br> the only world in our 
        solar system with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby  <br> Venus,
        Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal. <br> 
        The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for Earth, were n
        amed after Greek  <br>  and Roman gods and goddesses. However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, 
        which simply means “the ground.”</p>

                    Water is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly 
                    colorless chemical substance, which is the main constituent of Earth's 
                    hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms (in which it 
                    acts as a solvent).  
                    Two hydrogen atoms are attached to one oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45°.

                    <h2>Air:</h2>
                    Air is all around us, but we can’t see it. So what is air, exactly? 
                    It’s a mixture of different gases. The air in Earth’s atmosphere is made up 
                    of approximately 78 percent nitrogen and 21 percent oxygen. Air also has small 
                    amounts of lots of other gases,
                    too, such as carbon dioxide, neon, and hydrogen.
                    While air is mostly gas, it also holds lots of tiny particles. These particles in the air 
                    are called aerosols. Some aerosols—like dust and pollen—are picked up naturally when the 
                    wind blows. But the air can also carry soot, smoke, and other particles from car exhaust 
                    and power plants. 
                    A living thing takes in oxygen from the 
                    air and gives out carbon dioxide. This process gives animals and plants 
                    the energy to eat, grow, and live life!

                    gain access to groceries, medications, medical appointments, and transportation and 
                    with limited assistance with personal care.

                <p style="color: #04AA6D;"> 
                    In philosophy of mind, the term "world" is commonly used in contrast to the term 
                "mind" as that which is represented by the mind. This is sometimes expressed by 
                stating that there is a gap between mind and world and that this gap needs to be 
                overcome for representation to be successful. One of the central problems 
                in philosophy of mind is to explain how the mind is able to bridge this gap and to enter 
                into genuine mind-world-relations, for example, in the form of perception, knowledge or 
                action.This is necessary for the world to be able to rationally constrain the 
                activity of the mind.[29][34] According to a realist position, the world is something 
                distinct and independent from the mind. Idealists, on the other hand, conceive of 
                the world as partially or fully determined by the mind. Immanuel Kant's transcendental 
                idealism, for example, posits that the spatiotemporal structure of the world is imposed by the 
                mind on reality but lacks independent existence otherwise.[37] A more radical idealist conception 
                of the world can be found in Berkeley's subjective idealism, which holds that the world as a whole, 
                including all everyday objects like tables, cats, trees and ourselves, 
                "consists of nothing but minds and ideas".
