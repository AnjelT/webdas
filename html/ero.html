      <h3 id="newYork">About Italy</h3>
      <p id="about">Italy officially the Italian Republic (Italian: Repubblica Italiana is a country consisting 
        of a continental part, delimited by the Alps, a peninsula and several islands surrounding it. 
        Italy is located in Southern Europe, and is also considered part of Western Europe.
         A unitary parliamentary republic with Rome as its capital, the country covers a total area of 301,340 
         km2 (116,350 sq mi) and shares land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, and the 
         enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino. Italy has a territorial enclave in Switzerland 
         (Campione) and a maritime exclave in Tunisian waters (Lampedusa). With around 60 million inhabitants, 
        Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union.
        Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean, 
        Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures. In addition to the 
        various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy, the most
         predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name, 
         beginning from the classical era, Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly 
         in insular Italy, Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of 
         Southern Italy, while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively. 
         An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC, 
         which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People. The Roman 
         Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula, eventually 
         expanding and conquering parts of Europe, North Africa and Asia. By the first century BC, the Roman 
         Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural, 
         political and religious centre, inaugurating the Pax Romana, a period of more than 200 years during 
         which Italy's law, technology, economy, art, and literature developed. Italy remained the 
         homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire, whose legacy can also be observed in the 
        global distribution of culture, governments, Christianity and the Latin script.</p>
